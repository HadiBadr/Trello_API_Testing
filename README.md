## 1.Introduction

Welcome to the "Automated API Testing of Trello API using Rest Assured" project. This project aims to design, execute, and automate comprehensive API tests for Trello using Rest Assured. By setting up a structured Java-based testing framework and utilizing TestNG for automation, we ensure the reliability and functionality of Trello's API endpoints.

Key features include testing board, list, and card management functionalities, along with handling negative test scenarios and integration flows. Detailed test reports are generated using tools like Allure or ExtentReports, providing clear insights into the API's performance and reliability.

This project is ideal for software testers and developers looking to implement effective automated API testing practices.

## 3.Tool Selection process and its justification

Rest Assured is chosen for this project due to its simplicity and efficiency in testing RESTful APIs. As a Java-based library, Rest Assured provides a fluent and expressive syntax for creating, sending, and validating HTTP requests and responses. Its seamless integration with testing frameworks like TestNG makes it an ideal choice for automating API tests. With built-in support for JSON and XML parsing, authentication mechanisms, and extensive assertion capabilities, Rest Assured enables comprehensive testing of Trello's API endpoints with minimal setup and coding effort.
